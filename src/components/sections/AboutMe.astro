  Ever since discovering the power of code, I've enjoyed building and leaving an
  impact through digital experiences that bring real world solutions. I'm a
  former professional soccer player and a follower of Jesus passionate about
  technology and programming.

  I enjoy sharing what I learn and documenting my journey. Always looking to
  improve, learn, take on new challenges and help others on their journey.

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing soccer, reading, taking photos, playing
  guitar, and building meaningful relationships.
